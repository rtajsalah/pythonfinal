    <p>Minerals are materials that meet five requirements. They are: 1) naturally occurring, 2) inorganic, 3) solids,
      4) with a definite chemical composition, and 5) have an ordered internal structure. </p>
      <br>

    <p>Atoms, ions and molecules that form a mineral are present in the space in a way that creates geometrical shapes, known as crystal lattices. The structure of the crystal lattice defines the shape of the crystal as we see it.
      The colour of the crystal is controlled by it’s chemical composition and by occasional contamination with metal ions. This is why Topaz is yellow, Amethyst is purple while Ruby is red.
      <br>
      Another property of minerals is their hardness, which is their resistance to scratches.
      Hardness is classified by numbers (from 1 to 10), according to the Moh’s scale. Diamonds are the hardest mineral in nature!!! Other properties include Fracture or cleavage, Luster, Streak and Density.
      There are approximately 3800 known minerals and they are used in a wide range of applications related to construction, manufacturing, agriculture and energy supply. </p>
